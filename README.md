<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://github.com/Vedu36/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-SVM/blob/main/Breast_Cancer.csv].

The dataset consists of 569 samples and 32 features. Each sample includes an ID number, diagnosis (malignant or benign), and ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus:

Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

Symmetry

Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
